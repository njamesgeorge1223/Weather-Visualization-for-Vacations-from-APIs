In this Challenge, I created an IPython notebook, Weather.ipynb, to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator and write the results to a CSV file, CitiesWeather.csv, in the Resources folder. The CSV file became the input into my other IPython notebook, VacationsPy.ipynb, that uses the data to find ideal vacation spots.
