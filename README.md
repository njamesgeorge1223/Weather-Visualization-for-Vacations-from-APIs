The IPython notebook, Weather.ipynb, visualizes the weather of over 500 cities around the globe and writes the results to a CSV file, CitiesWeather.csv, in the Resources folder. The CSV file becomes the input file for the IPython notebook, VacationsPy.ipynb, that uses the data to find ideal vacation spots.
